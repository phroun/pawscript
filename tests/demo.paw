# PawScript Syntax Demonstration
# This file showcases all the major syntax features of PawScript

# ==========================================
# COMMENTS
# ==========================================

# Line comments start with # (when followed by whitespace or end of line)
echo "Line comments work"  # This is also a comment
echo "Line comments work = Good"

echo #( Block comments can span
   multiple #( lines )# and (use)
   parentheses. This should not print out. )# "This should #( actually )# print."
echo "This should :( actually ): print = Good"

#{ Alternative block comment style
   using braces instead }#

# Comments can contain special characters: !@#$%^&*()
# Comments can contain unicode: 🎉 émojis and accénts

#{ This comment can contain don't, can't, won't, and other contractions }#

#{ Comments can say "you can mention ')#' inside double quotes" without closing }#

#( Same rules apply: don't worry about single quotes here )#

#( But you can still mention "nested )# symbols" in double quotes )#

# ==========================================
# BASIC COMMANDS
# ==========================================

# Simple commands with no arguments
true
false

# Commands with arguments (comma-separated)

echo "quoted string = Good"

# ==========================================
# COMMAND SEPARATORS & FLOW CONTROL
# ==========================================

# Semicolon separator - always execute next command
write "First"; write "Second"; write "Third"
print

# Newlines act as semicolons
write "First"
write "Second" 
write "Third"

# AND operator (&) - execute next only if current succeeds

# OR operator (|) - execute next only if current fails
