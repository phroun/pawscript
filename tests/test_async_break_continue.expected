=== Test 1: Break in while loop after async operation ===
Got value: 1
Got value: 2
Got value: 3
Breaking at v=3
After while, count=3

=== Test 2: Continue in while loop after async operation ===
Processing v=1
Skipping v=2
Processing v=3
Skipping v=4
Processing v=5

=== Test 3: Break from paren group in while after async ===
Got 1
Got 2
Should have stopped at v=2

=== Test 4: Continue from paren group in while after async ===
Processing 1
Processing 4
Should have skipped 2 and 3

=== Test 5: Break in for loop with nested if ===
Iteration n=1
Completed n=1
Iteration n=2
Completed n=2
Iteration n=3
Breaking at n=3
After for loop

=== Test 6: Continue in for loop with nested if ===
Completed n=1
Skipping n=2
Completed n=3
Skipping n=4
Completed n=5
Completed n=6

=== Test 7: Break with level from nested async loops ===
Outer: 1
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Inner: 3
Outer: 2
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Breaking both loops!
After nested loops

=== All async break/continue tests complete ===
