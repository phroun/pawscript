=== Bitwise Module Tests ===

Test 1: bitwise_and with integers
0xFF AND 0x0F = 15
(Expected: 15)

Test 2: bitwise_or with integers
0xF0 OR 0x0F = 255
(Expected: 255)

Test 3: bitwise_xor with integers
0xFF XOR 0xAA = 85
(Expected: 85)

Test 4: bitwise_not with integer
NOT 0 = -1
(Expected: -1)

Test 5: bitwise_shl with integer
1 << 4 = 16
(Expected: 16)

Test 6: bitwise_shr with integer
256 >> 4 = 16
(Expected: 16)

Test 7: bitwise_rol 8-bit
0x81 ROL 1 (8-bit) = 3
(Expected: 3, because 10000001 -> 00000011)

Test 8: bitwise_ror 8-bit
0x81 ROR 1 (8-bit) = 192
(Expected: 192, because 10000001 -> 11000000)

Test 9: bitwise_and with bytes
AND result: <0F0A05>
(Expected: <0F0A05>)

Test 10: bitwise_or with bytes
OR result: <FFAA55>
(Expected: <FFAA55>)

Test 11: bitwise_xor with bytes
XOR result: <55AAFF>
(Expected: <55AAFF>)

Test 12: bitwise_not with bytes
NOT result: <FF0055>
(Expected: <FF0055>)

Test 13: bitwise_shl with bytes
Bytes << 4: <001000>
(Expected: <001000>)

Test 14: bitwise_shr with bytes
Bytes >> 4: <0100>
(Expected: <0100>)

Test 15: bitwise_xor with repeat
XOR cipher: <1D101919 1A>
XOR decipher: <48454C4C 4F>
(Expected: reversible cipher)

Test 16: bitwise_and with align left
Align left AND: <0F0F0000>
(Expected: <0F0F0000>)

Test 17: bitwise_and with align right
Align right AND: <00000F0F>
(Expected: <00000F0F>)

Test 18: bitwise operations on lists
List shifted left: (20, 40, 60)
(Expected: (20, 40, 60))

Test 19: bitwise_rol with bitlength 16
0x8001 ROL 1 (16-bit) = 3
(Expected: 3, because high bit wraps)

Test 20: bitwise_ror with bitlength 16
0x8001 ROR 1 (16-bit) = 49152
(Expected: 49152, 0xC000)

Test 21: XOR with longer second operand
Short XOR long: <55AA>
(Expected: <55AA>, takes rightmost portion of longer)

Test 22: XOR bytes with int, repeat
All zeros XOR 0xFF repeat: <FFFFFFFF>
(Expected: <FFFFFFFF>)

Test 23: OR preserves bits in non-overlap
OR with short mask: <AABBCCDF>
(Expected: <AABBCCDF>, only last byte affected)

Test 24: AND clears bits in non-overlap
AND with short mask: <0000000D>
(Expected: <0000000D>, non-overlap cleared)
