=== Test 1: break in while loop with if ===
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
Breaking at i=5
After while: i = 5

=== Test 2: continue in while loop ===
Processing i = 1
Processing i = 2
Skipping i=3
Processing i = 4
Processing i = 5
Skipping i=6
Processing i = 7
Processing i = 8

=== Test 3: break in for loop (numeric range) ===
n = 1
n = 2
n = 3
Breaking at n=4

=== Test 4: continue in for loop (numeric range) ===
Processing n = 1
Skipping n=2
Processing n = 3
Processing n = 4
Skipping n=5
Processing n = 6
Processing n = 7
Processing n = 8

=== Test 5: break in for loop (list iteration) ===
Item: apple
Item: banana
Breaking at cherry

=== Test 6: continue in for loop (list iteration) ===
Processing: apple
Skipping banana
Processing: cherry
Skipping date
Processing: elderberry

=== Test 7: break with level (nested loops) ===
Outer: 1
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Inner: 3
Outer: 2
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Breaking both loops!
After nested loops

=== Test 8: continue with level (nested loops) ===
Outer: 1
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Inner: 3
  End of outer iteration 1
Outer: 2
  Inner: 1
  Continuing outer loop from inner
Outer: 3
  Inner: 1
  Inner: 2
  Inner: 3
  End of outer iteration 3

=== Test 9: break in while with true condition ===
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Final count: 3

=== Test 10: break via & operator ===
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
Should have stopped at x=3

=== Test 11: continue via & operator ===
Processing x = 1
Processing x = 3
Processing x = 5
Should have skipped x=2 and x=4

=== All break/continue tests complete ===
