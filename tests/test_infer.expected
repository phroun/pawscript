=== infer Comprehensive Test ===

Test 1: Integer types
  42 → int (expected: int)
  -10 → int (expected: int)
  0 → int (expected: int)

Test 2: Float types
  3.14 → float (expected: float)
  -0.5 → float (expected: float)
  0.0 → float (expected: float)

Test 3: Boolean types
  true → bool (expected: bool)
  false → bool (expected: bool)

Test 4: nil type
  nil → nil (expected: nil)

Test 5: String types (quoted)
  "hello" → string (expected: string)
  "world" → string (expected: string)
  "" (empty) → string (expected: string)
  "42" (quoted number) → string (expected: string)
  "true" (quoted bool) → string (expected: string)

Test 6: Symbol types (bare identifiers)
  myvar → symbol (expected: symbol)
  identifier → symbol (expected: symbol)
  foo123 → symbol (expected: symbol)
  _underscore → symbol (expected: symbol)

Test 7: Block types (ParenGroup)
  (echo test) → block (expected: block)
  (code here) → block (expected: block)
  () (empty) → block (expected: block)

Test 8: Symbol vs String distinction
  admin (bare) → symbol (expected: symbol)
  "admin" (quoted) → string (expected: string)
  test (bare) → symbol (expected: symbol)
  "test" (quoted) → string (expected: string)

Test 9: Numbers as different types
  123 (bare) → int (expected: int)
  "123" (quoted) → string (expected: string)

Test 10: Special string values
  "false" (string) → string (expected: string)
  "0" (string) → string (expected: string)
  "nil" (string) → string (expected: string)

Test 11: Edge cases
  a (single char) → symbol (expected: symbol)
  "a" (quoted single char) → string (expected: string)
  x_y_z (underscores) → symbol (expected: symbol)
  CamelCase → symbol (expected: symbol)

Test 12: Type stability
  First call: symbol
  Second call: symbol
  Third call: symbol
  All should be: symbol

=== Summary ===

Expected type mappings:
  Bare identifiers (foo, bar) → symbol
  Quoted text ("foo", "bar") → string
  Numbers (42, 3.14) → int or float
  Booleans (true, false) → bool
  Null (nil) → nil
  Blocks ((code)) → block

If all results match expected, infer is working correctly!
