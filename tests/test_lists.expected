=== PawList Tests ===

Test 1: Creating lists
Empty list created
Fruits list created
Numbers list created
Mixed list created

Test 2: Type detection
Type of fruits: list
Type of nums: list
Type of empty: list
(Expected: list for all)

Test 3: List length (len command)
Length of empty: 0
Length of fruits: 3
Length of nums: 5
(Expected: 0, 3, 5)

Test 4: argc with PawList
argc of fruits: 3
argc of nums: 5
argc of empty: 0
(Expected: 3, 5, 0)

Test 5: argv with PawList (1-indexed)
First fruit: apple
Second fruit: banana
Third fruit: cherry
(Expected: apple, banana, cherry)

Test 6: Slicing lists
Slice [0:2] of fruits: apple, banana
Slice [1:4] of nums: 2, 3, 4
Slice [2:end] of nums: 3 items
(Expected: apple,banana | 2,3,4 | 3 items)

Test 7: Appending to lists (immutable)
Original length: 3
After append, new list length: 4
Original list length still: 3
Appended list items: a, b, c, d
(Expected: 3, 4, 3, a,b,c,d)

Test 8: Prepending to lists
Prepended list items: z, a, b, c
(Expected: z,a,b,c)

Test 9: Concatenating lists
Combined length: 6
Combined items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(Expected: 6, 1,2,3,4,5,6)

Test 10: Functional style (rebinding)
Starting with empty list: 0 items
After append first: 1 items
After append second: 2 items
After append third: 3 items
Final list: first, second, third
(Expected: 0, 1, 2, 3, first,second,third)

Test 11: Creating list from ParenGroup
List from paren length: 3
Items: red, green, blue
(Expected: 3, red,green,blue)

Test 12: Memory efficiency - slicing
Large list: 10 items
Small slices: 3, 3, 4 items
(All slices share backing array!)
(Expected: 10, 3,3,4)

Test 13: Compact operation
Tiny slice length: 2
Compacted length: 2
Items same: 1, 2
(Expected: 2, 2, 1,2)

Test 14: String slicing (works too!)
Original: hello world
Slice [0:5]: hello
Slice [6:end]: world
(Expected: hello world, hello, world)

Test 15: String length
Length of 'hello': 5
Length of empty string: 0
(Expected: 5, 0)

Test 16: Nested operations
Result length: 3
Result items: 1, 2, 99
(Expected: 3, 1,2,99)

Test 17: Lists containing variables
Coordinates: 10, 20, 30
(Expected: 10,20,30)

Test 18: Type preservation
Item 1 type: int
Item 2 type: string
Item 3 type: bool
Item 4 type: symbol
Item 5 type: nil
(Expected: int, string, bool, symbol, nil)
