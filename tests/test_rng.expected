=== Test 1: Create RNG with seed for reproducibility ===
Created RNG with seed 12345

=== Test 2: Generate random numbers with resume ===
Three random 0-99: 98 46 29

=== Test 3: Same seed produces same sequence ===
Same seed again: 98 46 29
Sequences match: true

=== Test 4: Range with min and max ===
Random 10-20: 20 13 11

=== Test 5: Default #random exists and works ===
Using inherited #random with seeded override below

=== Test 6: Override #random with seeded generator ===
Overridden #random: 62 90

=== Test 7: Local #random override for reproducibility ===
Local override: 75 11
Same seed again: 75 11
Local sequences match: true

=== Test 8: Unseeded RNG generates different values ===
Unseeded RNG produces different values: true

=== Test 9: Full Int63 range (no args to resume) ===
Full Int63: 2630686136689446574 2761839402383659414

=== Test 10: random command with default #random ===
random 100: 48 0

=== Test 11: random command with range ===
random 50, 60: 50 58

=== Test 12: random command with custom generator ===
With custom generator: 93 31
Same seed again: 93 31
Sequences match: true

=== All RNG tests completed ===
