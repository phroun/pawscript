=== Struct Mode Tests ===

Test 1: Endianness - 16-bit integers
BE stored 0x1234, read back: 4660
LE stored 0x1234, read back: 4660
(Both should be: 4660)

Test 2: Endianness - 32-bit integers
BE stored 0x12345678, read back: 305419896
LE stored 0x12345678, read back: 305419896
(Both should be: 305419896)

Test 3: Unsigned vs signed 8-bit
Signed 0xFF read back: -1
Unsigned 0xFF read back: 255
(Expected: -1, 255)

Test 4: Unsigned 16-bit
Signed 0xFFFF read back: -1
Unsigned 0xFFFF read back: 65535
(Expected: -1, 65535)

Test 5: Little-endian unsigned
LE unsigned 0x1234 read back: 4660
(Expected: 4660)

Test 6: Float32 big-endian
Float32 BE 3.14159 read back: 3.141590118408203
Float32 LE 3.14159 read back: 3.141590118408203
(Both should be approximately: 3.14159)

Test 7: Float64 big-endian and little-endian
Float64 BE 2.718281828 read back: 2.718281828
Float64 LE 2.718281828 read back: 2.718281828
(Both should be: 2.718281828)

Test 8: Mixed modes
ID (uint_le): 12345
Temp (float_le): 98.5999984741211
Name (string): Sensor1
(Expected: 12345, approx 98.6, Sensor1)

Test 9: Negative signed integers
Neg 8-bit: -42
Neg 16-bit BE: -1000
Neg 32-bit LE: -123456
(Expected: -42, -1000, -123456)

Test 10: Bit modes (booleans packed in 1 byte)
active (bit0): true
visible (bit1): false
selected (bit2): true
enabled (bit7): true
(Expected: true, false, true, true)

Test 11: Verify bit packing
Raw flags byte: <85>
(Expected: <85> which is 133 decimal: bit0 + bit2 + bit7)

Test 12: All 8 bits
All bits set, raw byte: <FF>
(Expected: <FF> which is 255)
