Test 1: Unpack list into variables
x = 10, y = 20, z = 30
Expected: x = 10, y = 20, z = 30

Test 2: Unpack ParenGroup into variables
a = 100, b = 200, c = 300
Expected: a = 100, b = 200, c = 300

Test 3: Dynamic targets from list
p = 5, q = 10, r = 15
Expected: p = 5, q = 10, r = 15

Test 4: More variables than values
m = 42, n = 99, o = <nil>
Expected: m = 42, n = 99, o = (nil or empty)

Test 5: Still works with simple assignment
simple = hello
Expected: simple = hello

=== NAMED ARGUMENT UNPACKING TESTS ===

Test 6: Named extraction with same key/var name (x:, y:)
x = 100, y = 200
Expected: x = 100, y = 200

Test 7: Named extraction with different key/var name (r: radius)
radius = 50, centerX = 10
Expected: radius = 50, centerX = 10

Test 8: Mixed positional and named extraction
name = Alice, age = 25, userId = 1001, job = Engineer
Expected: name = Alice, age = 25, userId = 1001, job = Engineer

Test 9: Named args skip over when extracting positional
first = 1, second = 2, third = 3
Expected: first = 1, second = 2, third = 3

Test 10: Named extraction from ParenGroup
x = 5, y = 10
Expected: x = 5, y = 10

Test 11: Missing named keys get nil
x = 100, y = <nil>, z = <nil>
Expected: x = 100, y = (nil or empty), z = (nil or empty)

Test 12: Complex mixed unpacking
name = Bob, country = USA, position = Developer, status = Active
Expected: name = Bob, country = USA, position = Developer, status = Active

Test 13: All positional still works (backward compatibility)
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Expected: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
