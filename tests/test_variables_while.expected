=== Testing Variables, Parenthesis Blocks, and While Loops ===

Test 1: Basic variables
Alice is old!
But, she's fine
Name: Alice
Age: 31

Test 2: Parenthesis blocks (same scope)
Inside block, counter = 5
Outside block, counter = 5
Expected: counter should be 5 both inside and outside

Test 3: Braces and variables
x = 10
doubled = 20
temp = 20
Expected: x=10, doubled=20, temp=20 (all accessible)

Test 4: Basic while loop
  Loop iteration 0
  Loop iteration 1
  Loop iteration 2
  Loop iteration 3
  Loop iteration 4
After loop, i = 5
Expected: printed 0,1,2,3,4 and i=5

Test 5: While loop result value
Result after while: false
Expected: 3

Test 6: While loop that doesn't execute
Result: before
Expected: 'before' (never touched)

Test 7: Nested while loops
  outer=0, inner=0
  outer=0, inner=1
  outer=1, inner=0
  outer=1, inner=1
  outer=2, inner=0
  outer=2, inner=1
Expected: outer 0,1,2 each with inner 0,1
